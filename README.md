# Pokédex Web App
## What do you want to know about your favorite Pokémon?

This is a simple WIP web app build for fun and practice with only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and consuming the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 
The code is still a bit of a mess and must be refactored. This is mostly because I build everything without much of a plan, just an idea and a lot of passion and improvisation. There are also buggy and missing features that I mean to fix ASAP, so please bear with me. 

Here are some things I intend for the future:
- Pokémon lore flavor text from Pokédexes from every game and generation that can be read one by one as you click a button. For now, it only shows one (and its positioning is a little off);
- Fixing the Pokémon species family box bugs (specially the "evolves to" part, that never shows anything);
- Fixing special case Pokémon names that won't show up, like Nidoran male and Nidoran female.
- Styling the scroll bar in the moves box so it fits better with the overall styling of the page;
- Clicking on a move will show a popup with detailed info about it;
- A less ugly and crappy header.
